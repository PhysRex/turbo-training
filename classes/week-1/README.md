# Week 1

## Goal
To start, let's figure out what to focus on. To do this, I'll give you a simulated coding interview, in two parts.
* take home project
* whiteboard test

### Take-home project
Make a simple to-do list webapp. The app should have the following features:

1. A user can add, edit and delete to-dos
2. Every to-do must have a name and description
3. Bonus: to-dos are stored (locally) and will be visible if the user returns to the site

### Whiteboard test
The format will be an interviewer asking you some basic questions about HTML, CSS, and JS for 30 mins. Then we'll go over the answers and do a Q&A.

## ABCs (Always Be Coding)
When you get board of working on the project you can read, watch, study, and code. Do one of these a day

### Read
I don't necessarily agree with all of these recommendations, but here are some mostly good tips to [make your life easier](https://medium.com/swlh/6-beginner-html-css-tips-guidelines-to-make-your-life-easier-ffa826143152).

### Watch

* 00:20 :  The #1 reason: Giving up
* 00:50 :  Tip 1 to supercharge the learning: Accept roadblocks
* 01:28 :  Tip 2 to supercharge the learning: Give yourself some time when hitting roadblocks (e.g. rest/ take a day off)
* 05:50 :  Importance of tenacity (unwilling to give up) and consistency.

#### [How To Think And Problem Solve In Coding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb9WUEXdkCE)
A little sales-y, but some good advice starting on 1:18
* Understand the problem, in plain English
* Break it down into smaller problems
* Create a plan of action

This just seems like fun!

### Study
You can google this stuff, and/or use the links below:
* **Box Model** One of the most fundamental things to learn (and one of the few you should memorize), [The CSS Box Model](https://css-tricks.com/the-css-box-model/).
* **Specificity** Learn about [specificity rules here](https://dev.to/emmabostian/css-specificity-1kca), or this is a [good resource too](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_specificity.asp)


### Code
Write separate functions for each of these:
* Given an array of numbers, return the sum of all the odd numbers
* Given a string, capitalize the first letter of every sentence.
* Print the current date in this format: Jun 24, 2020
