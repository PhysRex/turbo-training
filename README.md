# Turbo Training: Web Development

Intermediate learners -> **[start here](classes/week-1/README.md)**

## Purpose & Goal
This course covers all the fundamentals required to become a full-stack web developer. 

What does that mean? Full-stack simply means that you can handle all the technologies required to creating, deploy, and maintain a website. This is usually divided into two broad domains, frontend and backend. 

### Frontend
This involves everything that is seen and interacted by the user. All of the code is run on a browser or other user portal. languages/technologies include HTML, CSS, JS, and many others.

### Backend
This is all the code that doesn't involve direct user interaction, generally living on an external server(s). This could include hosting the website, managing browser/database transactions, things like routing, caching, and other application-wide tasks. Many different languages are used on the backend, and this course will focus on NodeJS. 

### Other requirements
* Developers will also need to learn about databases, devops, build processes, scripting, etc.
* Git is an essential tool in any software engineering team, and is also required.

## Overview
Here's a basic list what it takes to become a Full-Stack Web Developer. While it helps to see everything laid in a linear fashion, we won't cover these topics this way. Most of these topics are intertwined and rely on each other to greater or lesser extent to make modern-day websites and applications.

### HTML
Hyper Text Markup Language - This is a markup language used to structure and organize a website, on the frontend. Has a `*.html` file extension.

### CSS
Cascading Style Sheets - This is a type of language used to add style to websites (add color, change fonts, etc), on the frontend. Has a `*.css` file extension.

### JS
The meat-and-potatoes of front-end web development, Javascript is a Turning-complete programming language mostly used to handle all dynamic operations of a website. Generally this only runs on a browser and cannot access any information on your operating system (OS). For instance, interactions like posting to facebook, watching a video, searching , etc.

### Front-end frameworks/libraries
Libraries and frameworks are used to ease and speed up development. Some libraries are simply handing common tasks in a more intuitive way than the existing language. However, this can also involve creating new paradigms, changing how websites are developed. Some of the more popular ones are JQuery, React and Vue.

#### JQuery

#### ReactJS

#### VueJS

### NodeJs
NodeJS is basically the "backend version" of Javascript, which allows JS to be run on an OS-level and gives it read/write access. 

### Databases
A database is used to store information that can be retrieved by an application. Some examples of this are login information, banking records, gaming stats, etc. We'll learn the basics a SQL and noSQL DB.

### Git
The defacto Version Control System (VCS), git keeps track of all code changes made by a team/department/corporation and allows fine control over development and deployment. It is an essential but secondary tool for any software engineering project.
